  retranslated from the official Arabic governing text; article-by-article QA result
  **PASS (20/20, no minor fixes)**.
- **P1-002: remediation + QA completed** — 20 articles across Babs 3–6, retranslated from the
  official Arabic governing text; article-by-article QA result **PASS (20/20, no minor fixes)**.
- **P1-003: remediation + QA completed** — 20 articles across Babs 6–8 and 10, retranslated from the

- **P1-004: remediation + QA completed** — 16 articles across Babs 10, 12, 13 and 14, retranslated from
  the official Arabic governing text; article-by-article QA result **PASS (16/16, no minor fixes)**.
- **All P1 batches (P1-001..P1-004): remediation + QA completed** (each PASS, no minor fixes).
- **P2-001 (first P2 batch): remediation + QA completed** — 20 articles across Babs 1, 2 and 4,
  internal Chinese expanded from the official Arabic governing text (the prior candidate existed but was
  condensed); article-by-article QA result **PASS (20/20, no minor fixes)**.
- **P2-002 (second P2 batch): remediation + QA completed** — 20 articles across Babs 4, 5, 6 and 7,
  internal Chinese expanded from the official Arabic governing text (the prior candidate existed but was
  condensed); article-by-article QA result **PASS (20/20, no minor fixes)**.
- **P2-003: remediation + QA completed** — 20 articles across Babs 7, 8, 9 and 10, internal Chinese
  expanded from the official Arabic governing text (the prior candidate existed but was condensed);
  article-by-article QA result **PASS (20/20, no minor fixes)**.
- **P2-004: remediation + QA completed** — 20 articles across Babs 10, 11 and 12, internal Chinese
  expanded from the official Arabic governing text (the prior candidate existed but was condensed);
  article-by-article QA result **PASS (20/20, no minor fixes)**.

  full P2 expansion track is complete**.
- **P3-CONF-001 (final P3 confirmation batch): confirmation + QA completed** — 18 articles across Babs 2
  and 3, whose existing internal Chinese candidate is **retained verbatim as internal reference** (P3 is
  a confirmation/retain track, not expansion: no new Chinese text generated, nothing modified); each
  retention re-confirms the 189 semantic-QA finding (alignment high, near-full completeness) and the P3
  backlog finding; article-by-article QA result **PASS (18/18, no minor fixes)**.
- **The full Chinese remediation program (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3) is complete** — every backlog article is
  remediated, expanded, or confirmed-and-retained as internal reference, each with passing QA.
- **Closure audit completed** — a consolidated closure audit JSON, Arabic report, read-only
  validator, tests, and `make chinese-remediation-program-closure-validate` target verify that all
  281 articles across 15 batches (P0×5 + P1×4 + P2×5 + P3×1) are implemented with QA_PASS, no
  missing/duplicate articles, no prohibited content. See
  [`reports/chinese_translation_review/chinese_remediation_program_closure_audit.json`] and
  [`reports/chinese_translation_review/CHINESE_REMEDIATION_PROGRAM_CLOSURE_AUDIT_AR.md`].

## Implementing regulations

- **Implementing regulations intake scaffold created** — a clean scaffold for future
  Arabic official source intake of the Implementing Regulations of the Saudi Companies
  Law (M/132, 1443H), as a **separate corpus track** from the Companies Law. No Arabic
  text ingested, no English/Chinese text generated, no trilingual alignment, no public
  release. Arabic governs; not official/binding/governing; not legal advice. See
  [`data/implementing_regulations/intake_scaffold.json`] and
  [`reports/implementing_regulations/IMPLEMENTING_REGULATIONS_INTAKE_SCAFFOLD_AR.md`].
- **Listed joint-stock implementing regulation Arabic source intake completed** — 69 articles
  across 14 chapters + appendix, extracted from the official Umm Al-Qura gazette
  (uqn.gov.sa/decisions-and-regulations/4001295), published 1448-1-18 AH / 03-07-2026,
  issued by the Capital Market Authority board under Companies Law M/132 (1443H). This is a
  **specialized** regulation for listed joint-stock companies only, NOT a general implementing
  regulation. No English/Chinese text generated; no trilingual alignment; no public release.
  Arabic governs; not official/binding/governing; not legal advice. See
  [`data/implementing_regulations/listed_joint_stock/listed_joint_stock_implementing_regulation_arabic_source.json`] and

  (uqn.gov.sa/details?p=21325), published 1444-6-25 AH / 18-01-2023, under Companies Law
  M/132 (1443H). This is the **general** implementing regulation covering all company
  forms (general provisions, unlisted joint-stock, LLC, non-profit, professional
  companies, transformation/merger/division, final provisions). The listed joint-stock
  sub-track is a separate specialized regulation. No English/Chinese text generated; no
  trilingual alignment; no public release. Arabic governs; not official/binding/governing;
  not legal advice. See
  [`data/implementing_regulations/general/general_implementing_regulations_arabic_source.json`] and

  `make implementing-regulations-general-arabic-source-validate`.
- **General implementing regulations Arabic Legal LLM layer completed** — 95 article
  records across 7 chapters + 4 official form records, structured from the general
  implementing regulation Arabic source intake. official_text_ar preserved verbatim
  from the source; deterministic metadata per record (record_id, corpus_track,
  regulation_scope, chapter_number, chapter_title_ar, article_number, article_ordinal_ar,
  article_title_ar, official_text_hash, legal_status_boundaries, source_manifest_hash).
  Articles and forms in separate JSON files. No English/Chinese text generated; no
  trilingual alignment; no public release. Arabic governs; not official/binding/governing;
  not legal advice. Companies Law corpus and Chinese remediation program unchanged.
  Listed joint-stock sub-track is separate. See

  Arabic source intake. Specialized scope: listed joint-stock companies only (NOT a general
  implementing regulation). official_text_ar preserved verbatim from the source; deterministic
  metadata per record (record_id, corpus_track, regulation_scope, issuing_authority,
  legal_basis, article_number, article_ordinal_ar, article_title_ar, official_text_hash,

- **Implementing regulations Arabic program closure audit completed** — verifies both
  tracks (general: 95 articles + 4 forms; listed joint-stock: 69 articles + 1 appendix)
  are complete, all hashes match source intake, record IDs sequential and unique, tracks
  separate, listed joint-stock is specialized (not general), Arabic governs, no
  English/Chinese/trilingual/public release, Companies Law corpus and Chinese remediation
  unchanged. See
  [`reports/implementing_regulations/implementing_regulations_arabic_program_closure_audit.json`] and
